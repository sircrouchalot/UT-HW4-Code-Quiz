# UT-HW4-Code-Quiz

## Description
A short coding quiz, that counts down from 60 seconds when the user starts, and then records the time left over as their score. The user is then prompted for their initials and redirected to a highscores page where their score can be seen in relation to others'. The scores are also sorted so the highest is displayed first.

Previously, this app recorded user scores to localStorage, but it has now been adjusted to use MySQL and Sequelize to save those scores to a database.
